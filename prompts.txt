Markdown to CSV:
I want to create an interactive quiz for AWS Developer Associate (DVA-C02) using the questions from the README.md. But first, I want to create a CSV for the questions:

The CSV will have 3 columns: QUESTION, ANSWER_CHOICES, ANSWERS.

QUESTION will be a String
ANSWER_CHOICES will be a list of strings
ANSWERS will be a list of strings

Let us take an example, which is in lines 569 through 575 of the readme.

QUESTION:
A Developer wants to upload data to Amazon S3 and must encrypt the data in transit. Which of the following solutions will accomplish this task? (Choose TWO)

ANSWER_CHOICES:
['Set up hardware VPN tunnels to a VPC and access S3 through a VPC endpoint.', 'Set up Client-Side Encryption with an AWS KMS-Managed Customer Master Key.', 'Set up Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys.', 'Transfer the data over an SSL connection.', 'Set up Server-Side Encryption with S3-Managed Keys.']

ANSWERS:
['Set up Client-Side Encryption with an AWS KMS-Managed Customer Master Key.', 'Transfer the data over an SSL connection.']


Create a python file that can perform this action and output a csv in the same directory.
